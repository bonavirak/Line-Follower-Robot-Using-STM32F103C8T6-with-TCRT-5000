# Line Follower Robot with STM32F103C8T6 and TCRT5000

This Line Follower Robot, winner of Line Follower Robot Competition 2025, was designed and developed by Bona Virak. The project uses an STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller, TCRT5000 5-way sensors, HC-05 Bluetooth module, TB6612FNG motor driver, and N20 motors (1000 RPM). It implements PID control for precise line tracking with Case 0 and Case 1 logic for map navigation.

## Credits
- **Author**: Bona Virak - Sole developer of the code, PCB design, and implementation.
- **Team**: Tire-d - Acknowledged for participation in Line Follower Robot Competition 2025, with minimal contributions.

## Features
- C-based firmware with PID control for line following.
- PCB design (schematics, Gerber files, BOM) optimized for STM32 integration.
- Case-based navigation (Case 0, Case 1) for predefined maps.
